So javascript like most programming languages continues to grow new features are added but the way that
that happens is pretty different than most consumer software or operating systems.

JavaScript is implemented by all the different browsers out there and it's up to those browsers to implement
new features. 

So the way that it all works is that there's an organization called ECMA. They come up with standards for Ecmascript, like a specification for a programming language.
You can think of it as almost like a reference.It's a text document that says "Here is a specification for a programming language".

Then it's up to the browsers like Safari or Chrome or Internet Explorer to go and follow those rules
and implement them as javascript.

There's a committee called T.S. 39 at this Emma organization.They're the ones who are in charge of evolving and maintaining this massive document that describes
how Ecmascript should work.
