Methods used on Lists

.append(<value>) - Add a new value onto the end of a list.

.extend(<iterable>) - Make a list longer by adding on the members of another iterable.

.insert(<index>, <value>) - Add a value to a list at a particular index.

You can, of course, also add lists together with the + operator. To do this in place, you'd use the increment operator +=.

del - A keyword for removing items from iterables or deleting whole variables.

.remove() - A list method that removes items from a list by their value.

.pop() will remove and return the last item from a list.

.pop(<index>) will remove whatever item is at <index>, assuming something is.

If there's nothing left in the list, or the provided index isn't available, .pop() will raise an IndexError.
